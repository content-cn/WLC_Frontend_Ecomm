# E-commerce Project

## Problem Statement
The **E-commerce Project** is a fully functional e-commerce platform built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, signing up/signing in, and managing a shopping cart. It integrates with an **API** to fetch product data dynamically, includes search filters, and uses JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.

## Features

### 1. **Landing Page**
- **HTML Basics & Layout**: The landing page is built using **HTML** and styled with **CSS**. It includes a clean layout with a **Navbar**, **Main Section**, and **Footer**.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: The page layout is designed using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to ensure responsiveness across devices.
- **Pseudo-Classes & Elements**: Styles for various elements, including hover and focus effects, are implemented using **CSS pseudo-classes**.
- **Responsiveness**: The landing page adapts to various screen sizes using **media queries** and a flexible layout design.

### 2. **Responsive Signup/Signin Page**
- **Forms**: Users can **sign up** and **log in** securely. The forms are built with **HTML** and the layout is styled for a responsive experience using **CSS media queries**.
- **Form Handling**: **POST** and **GET** requests are handled to send user data to the backend or authentication service.
- **CSS Responsiveness**: Ensures the page adapts to all screen sizes using **container queries**.

### 3. **Product Page**
- **Dynamic Product Listing**: The **Product Page** dynamically displays products fetched from an external **API**.
- **JSON**: Product details are stored and rendered using **JSON data**, making it easy to update or expand the product catalog.
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic **CRUD** operations are implemented for product management (e.g., add, update, delete).

### 4. **Interactive Cart Page**
- **DOM Manipulation**: The **Cart Page** allows users to **add items** to the cart, **remove items**, and **update quantities** using **DOM manipulation**.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented **form validation** to ensure all necessary information is captured for orders.
- **Event Handling**: Proper **event listeners** are used to handle cart updates, item removal, and form submissions.

### 5. **API Integration**
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: The app uses **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await** for handling asynchronous operations like fetching product data.
- **Fetch API**: The **Fetch API** is used to retrieve product information and other dynamic content from the server or a mock API.

### 6. **Search Functionality**
- **Search Filters**: Users can filter products by categories or keywords using **debouncing** and **throttling** techniques in JavaScript to optimize search performance.
- **Advanced JavaScript**: Implemented **CRUD operations** on the products and used advanced **DOM manipulation** for real-time filtering and updates.

### 7. **Mastering OOP Concepts in JavaScript**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Advanced concepts like **inheritance**, **closures**, and **higher-order functions (HOFs)** are used for better code modularity and structure.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented across the application to ensure smooth user experience.

### 8. **E-commerce Error Handling**
- Implemented **error handling** in key processes, like **form validation**, **API data fetching**, and **cart management**, ensuring a smooth user experience even in case of errors.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the structure and styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, event handling, API integration, and search functionality.
- **JSON**: For dynamic rendering of product data.
- **Fetch API**: For fetching external product data and other resources.
- **Local Storage**: For saving and persisting the shopping cart data.
